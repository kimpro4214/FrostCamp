Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

## Project context

This is a Godot 4.7 portfolio project. Use the standard GDScript build of Godot, the `gl_compatibility` renderer, and keep the games ready for web export.

The project contains two game prototypes:
- **100초 군단 (`legion/`):** a survivors-like where the build you grow in each 100-second round returns as an enemy in later rounds.
- **포획 덱 (`capture_deck/`):** a roguelite deckbuilder where defeated enemies can be captured as cards with drawbacks.

Project rules:
- Keep game rules in `sim/`, separate from scenes and UI, so the game and bots run the same rules.
- Keep balance values in each game's `data/` files, not in code.
- AI drafts data and implementation. People define the problem and judge whether the game is fun. Bots measure balance only.
- Record bot results and AI experiment logs in `playtest/`.
- Split commits into small, fine-grained units of work.
- Write commit messages as `type: Korean description` with a type such as `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, or `chore`. Do not use a scope like `feat(legion):`. Name the game in the description when needed.
- Do not add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or other AI attribution lines to commit messages.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
